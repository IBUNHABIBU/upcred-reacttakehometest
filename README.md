## Live Demo
[Live Demo ](salum-microverse-final-capstone.netlify.app)

## Challenges faced

It was hard to implement image upload due to the following reasons

* in the front end these methods solved the issues
    
    I used formData
    I used withCredentials: true
    in the formData.append("modelname[attribue]", data)

* setMessage was not working due to history.push(/models)

    after removing it it worked

 After deploying my api to linode server my front end was not showingup
 after inspecting the element I found the following error
 `r.js:187 Mixed Content: The page at 'https://salum-microverse-final-capstone.netlify.app/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 'http://car.darlive.cyou/logged_in'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.`
 the solution is to use ssl certificate
